Fun-With-TwitterAPI
===================

Python and Twitter API

M showed me how to play with the API on the Twitter console.

This script is an example I used to load the current-most tweets based on the geocode. To eliminate retweets and the frequency of lazy kids/adults/kid-dults with poor grammar skills, I added keys to the search query like "-RT -ur -im" to increase the likelihood of tweets with complete sentences.
